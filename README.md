# Portfolio Site

The live version of this site can be found here: [https://plutoniumcat.github.io/](https://plutoniumcat.github.io/)

This is my personal portfolio site developed in React. Here I hope to showcase my past projects and provide an easy source for my contact information as a developer.

This site is currently under construction.
